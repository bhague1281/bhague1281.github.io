As 2016 comes to a close, I've been working on where I see myself in 2017 and beyond. Part of that vision includes revamping my personal site, which has gone to the wayside for a while. My last site used Jekyll/Bourbon featured a lot of custom elements on the front-end.

When redesigning my site, I took the following requirements into account:

1. I need the site done quickly (I've been procrastinating on redesigning it for a while).
2. I'll be updating the site with my projects, blog posts, contact information, and other information regarding my life fairly frequently
3. The site should look professional
4. Other than the domain name, I don't want to put any additional money into the site.
5. The site should require as little maintenance as possible

Since my existing site was a static site on Github Pages + Jekyll, I decided to go with these two technologies to satisfy points 2, 4 and 5. To satisfy the remaining two requirements, I went with a Jekyll Theme called [Halve](http://taylantatli.github.io/Halve/){:target="_blank"}.

I took the theme and did some minor color and image tweaks, as well as added some of my previous projects. Voila! A redesigned site for the new year. I hope you enjoy how it looks.

Now when I said I was working on where I see myself in 2017, I mentioned that this site played a role in that vision. But ultimately, I see this site as a place to talk about what I'm working on and what I plan to achieve next year.

In other words, I'm using this site to hold myself accountable for achieving my goals.

So the goals for this year?

* Travel more, by visiting different cities and towns.
  * Glasgow/Edinburgh/London (currently planned for April)
  * New York City
  * Victoria, BC
  * San Francisco
  * Reno
  * Montreal, Quebec
  * Spokane
* Hike and camp across the west coast. I'm planning on starting a YouTube channel in order to share these experiences.
* Release training videos relating to web development
* Freelance and experiment more with starting side projects/businesses
