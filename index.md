# About

I'm a software engineer and former web development instructor in Seattle WA. I currently work for [Concur Technologies](https://www.concur.com/){:target="_blank"} in Bellevue, WA.

### Current Projects

I'm currently working on side projects in Wordpress, Node/Express, and React. Additionally, I'm working on videos relating to web development, hiking, and travel. I love collaborating with people about these passions, so feel free to contact me if you'd like to talk.
